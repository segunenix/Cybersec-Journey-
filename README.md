⭐ Cybersec-Journey

This repository documents my **hands-on journey in cybersecurity**, from building a basic home lab to exploring detection, threat hunting, and defensive security tools.

I’m learning by setting up systems, breaking things, fixing them, and logging every lesson. It’s messy, but it’s real.


About This Project

This is a working repo where I track:
- My cybersecurity lab setup
- Blue team tooling (like Wazuh, Sysmon, Sigma rules)
- Real-time detection experiments
- Notes from challenges and tutorials
- Incident response templates
- Custom configurations and scripts


Why I'm Doing This

- To **build real-world security skills**
- To **document everything I learn**, so I can reflect and grow
- To **contribute to the community** (maybe my mistakes help you avoid yours)
- To one day **land a solid cybersecurity role** or internship


Roadmap

See [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) for my full learning and lab goals.
