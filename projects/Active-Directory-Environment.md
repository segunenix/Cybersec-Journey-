# Active Directory Home Lab Project üñ•Ô∏èüîê
## Introduction  
This project documents how I built and configured an **Active Directory environment** in my home lab. My main goals were to: - Learn how to deploy and manage a Windows Server Domain Controller.  
- Create and manage users, groups, and Group Policies.  
- Deploy Sysmon for endpoint logging.  
- Send logs to Splunk for security monitoring and analysis.  
- Document challenges and solutions for future reference.

## Lab Architecture  
- **Hypervisor:** VirtualBox
- **VMs Used:**  
  - Windows Server 2019/2022 (Domain Controller)  
  - Windows 11 Client  
  - Ubuntu Server (Splunk Enterprise)

## Setup Process  

### Network Configuration  
- Configured a custom NAT network.  
- Assigned static IPs:  
  - `192.168.10.7` ‚Üí Windows Server (Domain Controller)  
  - `192.168.10.100` ‚Üí Windows 11 Client

### Domain Controller Setup  
- Installed AD DS role on Windows Server.  
- Promoted server to Domain Controller.  
- Configured DNS and DHCP.  

### User & Group Management  
- Created organizational units (OU).  
- Added test users
- Grouped users for easier policy management.

## Security Monitoring  

### Sysmon Installation  
- Installed Sysmon on both Windows machine with a custom config(olaf config).
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/master/sysmonconfig.xml  
- Generated logs for process creation, network connections, and registry changes.  

### Splunk Integration  
- Installed Splunk Enterprise on Ubuntu Server.  
- Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder on both Windows machines.  
- Configured forwarders to send Sysmon logs to Splunk.

## Challenges & Fixes  
- **Problem:** Sysmon logs not showing in Splunk.  
  - **Fix:** Updated Splunk inputs.conf file (True and fales were suppose to be 1 and 0).

## Lessons Learned  
- Active Directory depends on DNS to function.  
- Group Policies are important for centralized security management.  
- Sysmon provides detailed telemetry for threat detection.  
- Splunk is effective for visualizing logs.
